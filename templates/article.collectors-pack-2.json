The Conductor was the premium product in basketball at the time. At DM 299, the performance shoe was pretty much the most expensive thing on the market in 1986. Ewing himself played all his NBA games in the New York Knicks colorway of this shoe at the time. However, since adidas knew that this price segment would be too high for many customers, they simultaneously brought out a similarly built, cheaper shoe. This was the Rivalry, which was available at the time as a high and a low version. To this day, both shoes are extremely sought after among collectors, as the adidas Ewing shoes also quickly gained cultural relevance and made a name for themselves both on and off the basketball court. Among people of the New York hip-hop, metal, and house scene, the shoes of the adidas Ewing collection were very popular. They were seen on the feet of musicians like Run DMC, Beastie Boys, and Anthrax, as well as in photos of legends like Jamal Shabazz and Janette Beckmann - both shoes became cultural icons, which led to the shoes being noticed in Europe as well.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_qJ96dq":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_x_Collective-1121_JuliaSchoierer_copy.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_ztNn8G":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>To this day, on the 50th anniversary of hip-hop, there are few shoes that have had such an impact as the Conductor and the Rivalry.

The upper of the Conductor is made of white grain leather. Italian faux snakeskin was again used around the collar. The three stripes match the overlay on the toebox in color and material. They come in a slightly hairy teasel suede. Special attention is paid to the tongue label. It was designed in reference to 80s tickets for the New York Knicks.
