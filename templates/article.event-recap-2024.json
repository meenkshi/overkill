Overkill celebrated its 20th anniversary. As befits Overkill, it was a little late, as the anniversary was celebrated in September 2023. But we had all the more to offer. Together with adidas, we released the “Anniversary Pack”, which consisted of three different models: ZX 6000, Equipment Guidance and Spiritain. True to the motto, the best of the 80s, 90s and 00s. In addition, all three models were also available as Friends & Family versions, allowing everyone to own one of these pairs. Despite the modest weather on the day, hundreds of ZX and EQT fans turned up at the release location. Thanks to the numerous participants, this Overkill x adidas release and the 20th birthday of Overkill can also be considered a complete success. <\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_tbJWCE":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/gif_4_bff3b8e0-9dba-477b-8879-b293bc30a789.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_4Qzxhy":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/gif_2_0d518598-e2c5-47c9-9a3d-2985815785c6.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"button_yApNpJ":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"Recap Overkill Anniversary Pack Release","button_link":"shopify:\/\/blogs\/news\/overkill-x-adidas-20th-anniversary-pack-f-f-dinner-release-recap","button_style":"primary"}},"text_XzR48H":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p><br\/><br\/>Every year in March, Nike celebrates Air Max Day.

The European Football Championship 2024 was held in Germany and we wouldn't be Overkill if we hadn't had something special to mark the occasion. Together with adidas, we created the perfect sneaker for this major event. The adidas ZX 8000 ‘Heimspiel’ is a tribute to the German national football team and features their colors. This model was exclusively available for purchase at Overkill in Berlin and Cologne. To promote the model properly, Overkill Marc slipped into the role of the groundsman. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0rC1RGQmPW4&t=2s\" title=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0rC1RGQmPW4&t=2s\"><strong>You can watch the cinematic masterpiece here<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_iyVp7R":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/1_53fd6d0b-7b94-4c8e-9e6a-860e0138f23a.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_6hNwPG":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/2_f12b58f4-10e1-43af-b0e7-dfa13af3b8ad.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"button_DggqGd":{"type":"button","settings":{"button_label":"recap adidas ZX 8000 Heimspiel Release","button_link":"shopify:\/\/blogs\/news\/recap-release-overkill-x-adidas-zx-8000-heimspiel","button_style":"primary"}},"text_inV6Bn":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p><br\/><br\/>At the beginning of July, the annual SEEK took place during Fashion Week.

A very special item of clothing was also presented on this day. In keeping with the European Championships, there was a football jersey, which was created in close cooperation with IFA Berlin, SEEK, Sony and Overkill and was only available on this day.
