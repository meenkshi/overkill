Overkill celebrated its 20th birthday a little later and here is the recap. <br\/>Together with adidas, we created the \"20th Anniversary Pack\" for this special anniversary. The sneaker trio consists of a ZX 6000, the EQT Guidance and the Spiritain 2000.

As the name suggests, many of our companions from the last few years were there. Almost the whole team, friends of the company, family members, and regular customers gathered in the extremely cool location. The former file archive with its steel floor, high shelves and archive cabinets was used for content creation and was the venue for the F&F dinner and release. The walls were decorated with canvases created especially for the occasion by graffiti artist friends. In addition to a beautiful floral decoration, you could also marvel at the different sample stages of the Anniversary Pack. After an aperitif and lots of great conversations with friends we hadn't seen for a long time, the official part of the evening began.<br\/><\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_nGydiW":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill-20-years-celebration-2.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_zeW6Ld":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill-20-years-celebration-3.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_PWVgPF":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>The guests took their seats at four large tables, on which various branded items could be found. Large acrylic coasters, glowing blue coasters, glasses, menus, name cards - all in the Overkill 20 design. In addition to the interesting conversations with our table neighbors, an incredibly delicious 3-course menu was gradually served. Our boss Marc used the short breaks to thank many people. Some of the team members were already celebrating their 10th anniversary, and Marc also thanked his family as well as former and current employees. After all the courses had been eaten, it was time to burn off the calories on the dance floor. Sascha Bertone and our legendary DJ Grobi played some hot electronic tunes and the crowd danced like there was no tomorrow. But there was, because just a few hours after the Friends & Family Dinner, the release party was due to take place.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_g8mzrJ":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_20th-Anniversary-Pack_Release_Event_4.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_Xp7xTt":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>After a few hours of sleep, the whole location was prepared for the release. There was a comfortable lounge area to relax in after all those hours of waiting. There were also snacks and hot and cold drinks. The latter, in particular, went down well with our audience. The first hardcore fans were already there on Thursday evening, but unfortunately, the weather didn't play along. It rained the whole time, so at this point a huge thank you to our community. We appreciate it and it's also proof that the Anniversary Pack and its design were exactly to people's taste. Even though the location could have accommodated more people at the same time, small groups were let in one by one for various reasons.<br\/><\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_HnfYWh":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_20th-Anniversary-Pack_Release_Event_1.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_77xwPT":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>The majority of people were of course after the limited edition Friends & Family shoes.

The fact that you could buy these at all was a special choice on our part because normally you can't get your hands on shoes like these.

The long wait was of course worth it for the people, even if we couldn't give every buyer an F&F, the crowd of around 350-400 people was still considerable. The time after the purchase was used to treat themselves to a drink or to examine the samples. There was also a graffiti sketch battle, the winner of which also received a Friends & Family shoe. Once again a great release event and a huge thank you to all of you out there, because without you there would be no Overkill. Also a big sorry for the rather suboptimal online release.
