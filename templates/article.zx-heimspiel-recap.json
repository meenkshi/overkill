Overkill stands for adidas ZX like no other shop in the world and we have once again proven this impressively. The ZX 8000 Heimspiel was available exclusively at Overkill. In addition to the in-store releases in Berlin and Cologne, we organized an online raffle and the response far exceeded our expectations. The design of the shoe picks up on the colors of the German national team - black, red and golden yellow - and thus celebrates Germany's football culture. Otherwise, the design was kept rather simple, but small details such as champagne-colored logos on the heel were a must.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_tnzxEz":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/1.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_wFA47R":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/2.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_aBBrTa":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/3.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_r7Ltkc":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>On Saturday 8 June, the time came and we started the release at 10.30 am with a slight delay. The venue was GATE, our boutique in the courtyard of our shops in Berlin-Kreuzberg. The showroom was decorated with pictures from the unique content created at the Olympic Stadium and the matching video of the groundsman was shown on the big screen. In addition, there were steles designed in the Heimspiel design on which samples from the creation process were presented. The entire area was covered with artificial turf to bring the stadium flair directly to the release. This space was also perfect for visitors to take a few souvenir photos. Hundreds of people were eagerly awaiting admission and we provided them with sandwiches and coffee while they waited.<br\/><\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_mxfUwb":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/4.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_JWGTPk":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_gbAXHM":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Fortunately, the weather gods had a good day and the sun shone over Berlin. In addition to the adidas ZX 8000, there were of course lots of goodies. We had various stickers and different postcards at the start, which were included with every purchase. Of course, the film poster for our iconic promotional video \"Der Platzwart\" was also available and sold like hotcakes. There were various seating options in the garden and the fridges offered refreshments such as soft drinks or a tasty shandy. There were various treats from the barbecue as well as potato salad. The list of people waiting in line was quickly completed and after the exertions, people were able to socialize with like-minded people in the backyard and enjoy the sunshine. Let's just hope that the German national football team gets as far as possible in the tournament and that we all experience a summer fairytale 2.0. Many thanks to everyone who came along on that day and congratulations to the who won the Raffle.
