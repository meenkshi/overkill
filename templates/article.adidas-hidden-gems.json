This year we have already seen some extremely interesting adidas Superstar collaborations. First and foremost Pharrell Williams with his long-term partnership with adidas and an obvious lover of the Superstar. Lately, he presented three different versions: the adidas Superstar 72, with a slim and elegant exterior, very much in the style of the 70s. The adidas Superstar 82, which stays with the modern cut and has only subtle changes. The adidas Superstar 92, on the other hand, comes across as a blown-up skate sneaker with a 90s aesthetic. Similar to the Campus 00s, everything is a little thicker and chunkier. If you imagine the model with thick laces, Missy Elliot might just come around the corner. The fact that the Superstar always manages to reinvent itself is proof of its cult status, with each generation adapting the model in its way.
