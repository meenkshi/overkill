There is even a rule for this, as it has been discovered that fashion trends repeat themselves approximately every 20 years. Some of them only have a short second life and with some, you wish they wouldn't come back. Even in the age of social media, where fashion trends spread across the globe at lightning speed and are sometimes only popular for a short time, we find the 20-year cycle again. For our Y2K sneaker editorial, the circle has come full once again. The trend started back in 2023, when sneaker silhouettes from the early 2000s were increasingly reissued as retro versions. Our focus is therefore less on the clothing from this period than on the sneakers, and there are plenty of them.<br\/><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.overkillshop.com\/en\/men\/sneaker\/y2k\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>YOU CAN FIND ALL Y2K RUNNING SNEAKERS HERE AT A GLANCE.<\/strong><\/span><\/a><br\/><br\/>While the general Y2K shoe trend includes different silhouettes such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.overkillshop.com\/en\/brands\/adidas\/campus\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>adidas Campus 00s<\/strong><\/span><\/a>, we want to focus on the running sneakers of the 2000s. Of course, the big brands lead here, but we'd also like to recommend a few exotics. Y2K sneakers have replaced the dad sneaker trend. The chunky sneaker models are now light-chunky and have become much more commercial and successful. <br\/><br\/><br\/><strong>ASICS Y2K SNEAKER<br\/><\/strong>Let's start with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.overkillshop.com\/en\/brands\/asics\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Asics<\/strong><\/span><\/a>. The Japanese sports shoe brand stands for running sneakers like no other. With the cushioning GEL technology, Asics sneakers are also very comfortable. Asics has also managed to go from being an insider tip to a trendsetter with its products. While other brands sometimes design new sneakers that do justice to the retro trend, Asics has an almost endless archive of Y2K sneaker models. <\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_tnzxEz":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/GEL-1130-small.gif","image_width":700,"url":"shopify:\/\/collections\/asics-gel-1130"}},"text_y3RyeC":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.overkillshop.com\/en\/brands\/asics\/gel-1130\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Asics GEL-1130 <\/strong><\/span><\/a>was first launched in 2008 and is now one of the bestsellers.

Of course, the traditional brand from Herzogenaurach can serve the Y2K sneaker trend. The adidas archive offers a variety of performance sneakers from the Millennium.
