Overkill is Berlin and Berlin is Overkill, so it was a no-brainer to do something special for the release of the adidas Berlin. There are 118 different Berlins all over the world and we visited the REAL Berlin, which is also the oldest. It was already mentioned in a document in 1215 and is therefore 22 years older than the Berlin that Overkill comes from. The small village, which is 357 KM away from the big Berlin, has barely 600 inhabitants. There are famous Berlin places like Unter den Linden, Kurfürstendamm, Potsdamer Platz, and many more, which can also be found in other Berlin. Our protagonist Paule has ordered the adidas Berlin at Overkill and is now eager to go to Berlin finally. He has already heard a lot about the city and its inhabitants, now he wants to visit the place to the shoe and book himself a ride. He walks around the city and takes in all the sights, he meets nice Berliners (they do exist there!), he enjoys the best kebab in town, and he does it all with his new pair of adidas Berlin on his feet. Do it like Paule and secure your adidas Berlin on 31.3. at midnight in our online shop.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}}},"block_order":["text_xqV49m"],"settings":{"height":"small","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}},"scrolling_banner_VinnFy":{"type":"scrolling-banner","blocks":{"image_nqN6HJ":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-0017.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_TnDyqy":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-0059.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_f8kBhT":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-0296.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_kqbpmd":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-0347.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_q6xjp6":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-0507.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_qkE9Hj":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-0681.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_DckELf":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-0917.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_y4eD38":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-0961.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_je73AF":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-1149.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_9GhU9n":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-1153.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_kkKMdL":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-1529.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_NxGUgK":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-1701.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_ymBy3a":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/FINAL-LOWRES-OVERKILL-ADIDAS-BERLIN-2173.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}}},"block_order":["image_nqN6HJ","image_TnDyqy","image_f8kBhT","image_kqbpmd","image_q6xjp6","image_qkE9Hj","image_DckELf","image_y4eD38","image_je73AF","image_9GhU9n","image_kkKMdL","image_NxGUgK","image_ymBy3a"],"settings":{"full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default","text_size":16,"vertical_padding":71,"speed":10,"direction":"left","font":"heading","space":10}},"rich_text_X9BEjd":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"text_LC9NjG":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>The adidas Berlin is one of the classics from the City series of the brand with the three stripes.
