Rudi Dassler was an accomplished businessman and the more extroverted of the two brothers. Adi, on the other hand, was more introverted, but very talented as a craftsman and therefore responsible for the production of the shoes. In the beginning, the \"Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik\" portfolio mainly comprised sports shoes for football and running. The first Dassler sports shoes were used as early as 1928 at the Olympic Games in Amsterdam and won gold. Probably the greatest success of these early years was achieved during the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, when Jesse Owens wore Dassler sports shoes and won four gold medals. During their years together, there were various differences of opinion, which led to the separation of the two brothers after the Second World War. Rudolf Dassler then founded Puma in 1948, before adidas was registered as a trade mark in 1949. The joint employees had the choice of working for Puma or adidas and so it came about that two of the largest sporting goods manufacturers had their headquarters in a small town in Bavaria. There are many myths about the separation of the brothers. Lots of books and films have been made on the subject, but there is no real certainty about the actual reasons. <br\/><br\/>On 18 August 1949, adidas was founded with 47 employees and on the same day, Adi Dassler patented a sports shoe and registered three parallel stripes as a trademark. Adi Dassler was driven by the desire to design the best possible shoes for athletes in their discipline. As he was active in athletics himself and spent a lot of time talking to athletes, he managed to make a name for himself and his sports shoes sold like hot cakes.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_tBhnjd":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Adolf-Dassler-Adi-adidas-shoemaker-shoes-sports-company-creator-innovator-Germany-1440x9999_xhqsqb.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_J6ETtp":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<h5>The miracle of Bern and the rise of adidas<\/h5><p>The football boots that Adi Dassler designed were also highly appreciated by the German national team. In the so-called \"Miracle of Bern\" during the 1954 World Cup, the players wore shoes with the three stripes. In addition to the low weight, one of adidas' many innovations were replaceable studs in the soles. Legend has it that this was the decisive factor in the victory, as Adi attached different studs to the players' shoes shortly before the final. Through the first television broadcast of the tournament, adidas shoes became known to a worldwide audience. <br\/><br\/>In the late 1960s, at the request of national team coach Sepp Herberger, Adi Dassler ordered training pants and jackets with three stripes exclusively for the national team from the Schwahn company. The Schwahn company was later bought up and, together with Franz Beckenbauer as the first brand ambassador, a tracksuit named after him was created in 1967. This was the first item of clothing from the brand that was available for purchase by the end consumer.

In 1960, the Dasslers left their son in charge of the adidas factory in Dettwiller, France. Horst Dassler was just 23 years old at the time, but his work and what followed from it can still be felt today. The young Dassler offspring was a personality in world sport and had great influence. Even then, he recognized the influence of the Olympic Games and other major events such as the Football World Cup. He expanded his influence through skillful marketing and the founding of other companies. Or rather, the influence of adidas and the advertising for the brand's products. The French production facility designed countless shoes that were far ahead of their time and recognized worldwide.

After the untimely death of Adi Dassler in 1978, Horst Dassler was brought back to Herzogenaurach, where he ran the company together with his mother Käthe until her death in 1984.

Although Adi Dassler forbade his son Horst from entering the swimwear market, he founded the Arena brand in 1972 via Adidas France. Arena was sold in 1990. Horst had previously secured the production and distribution rights from adidas France and thus built up a textile company in France. While Horst was interested in adidas clothing, his father remained skeptical about adidas apparel and leisure fashion in particular. At the insistence of his wife Käthe, Adi had a logo designed for the 1972 Summer Olympics, known as the Trefoil. This logo later became the official company logo and was used for all clothing products. Previously, the brand's logo was a globe, which served as the inspiration for the trefoil. The three individual parts of the Trefoil forms a closed sphere.

Another advantage was that the adidas shoes were easily recognizable from a distance, which was particularly useful for sports broadcasts on television. At the 1952 Summer Olympics, however, Dassler noticed that the Finnish brand Karhu was also fitting its shoes with three stripes. Legend has it that adidas only paid Karhu €1600 and two bottles of whiskey for the rights to the three stripes. <br\/><br\/>In 1989, a new logo was developed with the help of visionary designers and creative experts. In 1991, the adidas Equipment logo was released, consisting of the three stripes and the lettering. Initially, the logo was used exclusively for the adidas Equipment series and in the newly developed sports green colour, it adorned shoes and clothing from this series.

By this time, the adidas Superstar had gone from technical basketball sneaker to street fashion. The brand's cult status was confirmed when US Hip-Hop group Run DMC began wearing adidas as part of their signature look. Their love of adidas trainers was immortalized in the song \"My adidas\". adidas itself only found out about this fondness when an employee attended a Run DMC concert and saw them lift their adidas shoes into the air in front of 40,000 fans. This event kicked off the first ever advertising deal between a music group and a sports company and started a lifelong relationship that continues to this day. This was to be the cornerstone for many other musicians who worked with adidas in the years that followed. In the early 2000s, Missy Elliot was regularly dressed from head to toe in adidas and had her own collection of clothing and sneakers. Beyonce and her label Ivy Park had a partnership and several apparel and sneaker releases. All this long-standing relationship between hip-hop and adidas culminated in the release of the first adidas Yeezy model in 2015. Rapper Kanye West left competitor Nike shortly before and was allowed to release the first sneakers with his label Yeezy. The adidas Yeezy Boost 750 was the first model from the collaboration between West and adidas. In the following six years, more than 200 colorways for 19 different models were released. The Yeezy Boost 350 in its variants is one of the most successful models in the series. Speaking of success, the collaboration paid off for both parties; no collaboration between a non-athlete and a brand has ever been as financially successful as the one between adidas and Kanye West.

Starting with the adidas Equipment Racing \"Taxi\" which was released in 2015. It continued with the EQT Support ADV and the EQT Support Future in 2017, two models that were to lead the legendary Equipment series into the future. 2017 also saw the launch of the Consortium Sneaker Exchange program, which focused on two Wmns models. Another pioneering project was realized with the AM4 Overkill from the adidas Speedfactory. This was followed in 2019 by the global market launch of the adidas ZX 10,000, a model that expanded the adidas ZX series. True to the motto: I can if I want, we have combined a pair and a single shoe in one big box, this kind of marketing is still a milestone from<br\/>Overkill. In the same year, the \"Game Overkill\" followed, another adidas ZX 10K inspired by the Game Boy. In 2021, the adidas CSG 91 got an Overkill makeover. The model is a hybrid of three different sneakers from the adidas Equipment series. The continuation of the adidas AZX series led to the extremely loud and graffiti-inspired adidas ZX 8500, another hybrid model released in 2021. However, we celebrated our 20th anniversary with a little delay but three times. The \"Anniversary Pack\" consisted of the adidas ZX 6000, Equipment Guidance and the Y2K Running model Spiritain. The Overkill x adidas ZX 8000 Heimspiel was released as the last model for the time being and in the course of the European Football Championship. A declaration of love for football and inspired by the jerseys and the national colors. It will be interesting to see what else adidas and Overkill come up with together in the future.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"text_UfPGxG":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>75 years of adidas, a time full of highs and also a few lows, full of records and innovative milestones.
