The \"Bring Back\" pack from adidas was launched. Two iconic colorways from the rich ZX history were reissued. One is the adidas ZX 8000 with the epithet \"Germany\", borrowing from the model's Black Red Yellow colorway. The other is the adidas ZX 9000 \"Citrus\". Both models are highly sought after by collectors, so it's even nicer for the ZX community that this release finally happened.<br\/><br\/>For the ZX Citrus shoot, we traveled to sunny Portugal. There we were able to perfectly set the cheerful and sunny mood of the sneaker. With lots of good moods, the best weather and of course a lot of lemons, we went on vacation vicariously for you. What's better than summer, sunshine and a fresh pair of shoes on your feet?! With the adidas ZX 9000 Citrus, you have all of these things combined.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_tnzxEz":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_x_Adidas_ZX_9000_Citrus_4x5_5.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_dKhdqj":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_x_Adidas_ZX_9000_Citrus_4x5_29.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_WFGczn":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_x_Adidas_ZX_9000_Citrus_4x5_20.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_m4TABi":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_x_Adidas_ZX_9000_Citrus_4x5_11.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_FtGdKw":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>For the ZX 8000 Germany shoot, we portrayed three people. We talked to them about their roots, their sense of identity and their relationship to Germany. All three have their family roots outside of Germany, so it was exhilarating to learn about their relationship with Germany. Whether they are hairdressers, restaurateurs or kiosk owners, each one reports from a different perspective.<br\/><br\/>The in-store release now took place last Friday. Our boss Marc had made his way to our store in Cologne to personally hand over their shoes to the ZX community on-site. In Berlin, it was relatively quiet by ZX standards, but it was incredibly nice to see familiar faces again. After the difficult Corona phase and the non-occurrence of in-store releases and activations, we were happy to be able to do this again finally.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_LBBznW":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/2.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_4cNAN7":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/4.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_BNrNL6":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/3.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_qkyDfn":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/8.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_JYwEFf":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Those who know us from Overkill, know that we don't let ourselves down when it comes to special goodies for selected releases.

Especially for the ZX Citrus, there was another highlight in the form of a \"seeding package\" and this term can be taken literally. The first buyers were able to enjoy a lemon-themed box. This included: 1 lemon tree in a pot, as well as extra lemon seeds, 1 watering can, 1 garden set and 1 keychain in the shape of a lemon. Of course all with the Overkill branding and a nice giveaway to our loyal customers.<br\/><br\/>We hope you enjoyed the release as much as we did!
