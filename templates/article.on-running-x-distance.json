This time we were invited by On Running to Paris to participate in a very special running event. What our Overkill Running Team experienced there, you can read in our recap. 32 teams from different countries competed in a relay race. To brave the weather, the event took place in a parking garage, which had a 700-meter circuit. To give you first-hand info, we asked our team member Lea a few questions about this event.<\/p><p><strong>Hey, please introduce yourself briefly. <\/strong>Hiii, my name is Lea and since I've been working at Overkill as a social media manager, I'm slowly but surely becoming a sneakerhead.<\/p><p><strong>What was the reason for your trip to Paris? <\/strong>To run around the city and eat as many croissants as possible! But seriously, we were invited by On Running and Distance to an exciting event because they both did a shoe together.<\/p><p><strong>What tasks did you have to complete during the event? <\/strong>The task was super simple, we \"just\" had to beat 31 teams of runners while running as fast as we could uphill and downhill across the course. Spoiler alert: we didn't make it, not even a professional runner on our team could save us. Thanks at this point to Leona from Kraft Runners for fighting with us. In the end you have to say, we are just sneaker lovers and not runners, hehe.<\/p><p><strong>Where did the other running groups come from? <\/strong>Besides us Berliners, there were crews from DÃ¼sseldorf and Copenhagen. But the majority of the teams came directly from Paris, where there are a lot of such groups of runners.<\/p><p><strong>Which On Running sneaker did you wear? <\/strong>Of course, the model we've been talking about all along, the On Running Cloudlfow 4 Distance.<\/p><p><strong>What did you discover in Paris, what was your highlight? <\/strong>It was my first time in Paris and I was very excited to explore the city. Maybe I'm not a fast runner, but I covered almost 60 km through Paris in 3 days, where's my medal for that?! I can confirm that the On Running Cloudflow 4 Distance is great for long walks, as well as fast running. My highlight was the Bar Folderol, their specialty: ice cream paired with natural wine, I love the concept.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}}},"block_order":["text_Nk9EaR"],"settings":{"height":"small","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}},"scrolling_banner_pkEANh":{"type":"scrolling-banner","blocks":{"image_WQyztw":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20231101_OK_OnRunning_Paris_Event_PhotoContent_0002.webp","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_dqQcfY":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20231101_OK_OnRunning_Paris_Event_PhotoContent_0005.webp","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_TYwLbW":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20231101_OK_OnRunning_Paris_Event_PhotoContent_00018.webp","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_aXw6Dm":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20231101_OK_OnRunning_Paris_Event_PhotoContent_0009.webp","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_ptF9h7":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20231101_OK_OnRunning_Paris_Event_PhotoContent_00012.webp","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_j9FxKa":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/08_OK_Paris_Analog_3_4d3f9f55-8cf0-4071-b9f8-31b18b25f12a.jpg","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_x4rC74":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20231101_OK_OnRunning_Paris_Event_PhotoContent_0008.webp","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_hLWCEC":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20231101_OK_OnRunning_Paris_Event_PhotoContent_00016.webp","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_i4PiVN":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20231101_OK_OnRunning_Paris_Event_PhotoContent_00019.webp","image_width":400,"link":""}},"image_XfTPW8":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20231101_OK_OnRunning_Paris_Event_PhotoContent_00017.webp","image_width":400,"link":""}}},"block_order":["image_WQyztw","image_dqQcfY","image_TYwLbW","image_aXw6Dm","image_ptF9h7","image_j9FxKa","image_x4rC74","image_hLWCEC","image_i4PiVN","image_XfTPW8"],"settings":{"full_width":true,"color_scheme":"default","text_size":16,"vertical_padding":100,"speed":17,"direction":"left","font":"heading","space":20}}},"order":["image_with_text_overlay_D4wNxr","main","rich_text_3YdLtm","rich_text_mUnWNK","scrolling_banner_pkEANh"]}
