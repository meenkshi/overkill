An official partnership has existed since 2001 and many Formula 1 racing drivers are equipped with Puma shoes. The first models were boots made of thin leather and suede and were introduced in 1984. The Puma Speed Cat made its debut in 1999, at a time when the world of motorsport was bursting with popularity. Puma, always at the forefront of sporting innovation, sought to create a shoe that would fulfill the specific needs of racing drivers while appealing to a wider audience of sneaker fans. The Speed Cat was inspired by the sleek, agile nature of big cats and the need for precise control and grip in motorsport. The low-profile silhouette gave drivers a better way to control their vehicles. In 2006, Puma entered into a long-term partnership with the Ferrari racing team. From then on, Formula 1 legend Michael Schumacher could be seen with Puma Speedcat on his feet, which helped the model achieve enormous success. According to Puma archivist Helmut Fischer, the Puma Speedcat is the best-selling Puma sneaker of all time.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_T77qwq":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/GATE_PUMA_SPEEDCAT-3.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_T3HWd6":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/GATE_PUMA_SPEEDCAT-38.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_FzfA6F":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p><strong>The materials: a perfect blend of function and comfort<\/strong><br\/>The Puma Speed Cat is a testament to Puma's commitment to using high-quality materials that enhance both performance and comfort.
