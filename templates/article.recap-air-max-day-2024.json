Air Max Day is celebrated every year on March 26th and this year, celebrating was also the top priority. But first things first. For Air Max Day 2024, Nike has added a new model to the legendary Air Max series. The Air Max DN is a new dynamic silhouette and knows how to please with its futuristic design. The first version is available with a white or black upper, each with subtle Nike branding. However, the highlight is probably the sole unit, which is equipped with 4 semi-circular air cushions and has an unmistakable design.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_tnzxEz":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/gif_01.gif","image_width":260,"url":""}},"image_g8eBGY":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/gif_02.gif","image_width":260,"url":""}},"text_NGVyKY":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Overkill and Nike hosted an Air Max Rave to celebrate Air Max Day in style. The venue was an old department store that had been completely gutted to create a cool industrial look. Various displays that were perfectly integrated into the scenery allowed the Nike Air Max DN to shine in the best light. The musical accompaniment for the evening was provided by the who's who of Berlin's hottest electronic music DJs. DJ Gigola kicked things off and got the first few people fired up as the queue outside the venue grew longer and longer. With a total capacity of 600 people and at least that many more in front, the old C&A department store in Neuk√∂lln brought up the temperature. With free drinks and good tunes blasting from the speakers, the guests stomped their way toward midnight. The Berlin techno duo Brutalismus 3000, with whom we also did the content creation for the Air Max DN, played a wonderful DJ set. The legendary MCR-T, a solo electronic entertainer par excellence, rounded off the evening perfectly.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_eF6CDk":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/gif_03_a0bff966-0c34-4c88-a58b-868a3788db6e.gif","image_width":260,"url":""}},"image_nMxTjB":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/gif_04.gif","image_width":260,"url":""}},"image_izkc8h":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/gif_05.gif","image_width":260,"url":""}}},"block_order":["text_Nk9EaR","image_tnzxEz","image_g8eBGY","text_NGVyKY","image_eF6CDk","image_nMxTjB","image_izkc8h"],"settings":{"height":"small","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}}},"order":["main","rich_text_3YdLtm","rich_text_mUnWNK"]}
