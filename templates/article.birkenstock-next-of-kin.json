You may think that we as a sneaker store would be the wrong address for it, but far from it! Both in the team, as well as among the clientele, Birkenstock is a sought-after brand. The comfortable sandals with the footbed made of cork, are the perfect alternative if you want to give your battered sneaker feet some rest.Â <br\/><br\/>In addition to all the classics of Birkenstock, such as Arizona or Boston, there is now a new model. The Birkenstock Naples is the latest member of the sandal family. The most striking innovation is the upper shoe, which has the shape of a moccasin.The sandal is closed at the front and has an angular toe, which is attached to the upper with a decorative seam. Instead of a buckle, the model has an additional strap with a significant cutout, which also has decorative stitching. The upper is made of suede, but you can also buy the Birkenstock Naples with oiled leather. The soft upper and fit create a next-to-skin feel. The rest of the features are what we love Birkenstock sandals for. Anatomically molded cork-latex footbed, Birkengrip sole made of EVA midsole and rubber outsole: slip-resistant, durable, and flexible. In the Birkenstock Naples, the footbed is also partially covered with suede, which adds a touch of luxury to the model.<br\/><br\/>To celebrate the launch of the Birkenstock Naples, Overkill once again creates something bigger. True to the claim: <em>Next of Kin<\/em>, we visited young and aspiring artists in their homes or studios (sometimes both were the same) and photographed the Birkenstock Naples in its natural habitat. Included were: Illustrator Ilias Walchenhofer, Singer & Songwriter Duo Next of Din, painters Suna Plessing and Ella Silva, painters Martin Dreves Castillo and Pascal Schattenburg, as well as graphic designer Julian Meinert, who is also creative director at Overkill. You can see the results of the shootings here down below.<br\/><br\/>But that's not all, because we also wanted to give the artists the opportunity to show their work to the people out there. So we organized a small but nice exhibition at the HVW8 Gallery in Berlin, including a vernissage, and open to the public for a few days. Besides the artworks of all participants, there were free drinks and nice conversations, which were not only about art.<br\/><br\/>We would like to thank Birkenstock for their trust, after all, it was the first activation they ever did. We are already looking forward to further activations. Also a big thank you to all the artists involved.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}}},"block_order":["text_Nk9EaR"],"settings":{"height":"small","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}},"video_3cAmWm":{"type":"video","blocks":{"play_button_JQMRMd":{"type":"play-button","settings":{}}},"block_order":["play_button_JQMRMd"],"settings":{"video_shopify":"shopify:\/\/files\/videos\/Overkill_x_Birkenstock_Recap_V2.mp4","video_external":"","video_description":"Recap","text_alignment":"center center","full_width":false,"overlay_style":"no_background"}},"rich_text_B8Frwy":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"image_dhBJDr":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/230302_overkillxbirkenstock_releaseevent_naples_-13.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_mbVm39":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/230302_overkillxbirkenstock_releaseevent_naples_-2.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_YjcKnh":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/230302_overkillxbirkenstock_releaseevent_naples_-97.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_9Mmft9":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/230302_overkillxbirkenstock_releaseevent_naples_-68_Kopie.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_rJb4pi":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/230302_overkillxbirkenstock_releaseevent_naples_-2_Kopie.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_mEbgbE":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/230302_overkillxbirkenstock_releaseevent_naples_-125.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_WhBNzR":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/230302_overkillxbirkenstock_releaseevent_naples_-234.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_z4JqbE":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_birkenstock_naples_4x5-100.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_g3U4nm":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_birkenstock_naples_4x5-121.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_4G6zDY":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_birkenstock_naples_4x5-134.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_GjKifJ":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_birkenstock_naples_4x5-160.jpg","image_width":700,"url":""}}},"block_order":["image_dhBJDr","image_mbVm39","image_YjcKnh","image_9Mmft9","image_rJb4pi","image_mEbgbE","image_WhBNzR","image_z4JqbE","image_g3U4nm","image_4G6zDY","image_GjKifJ"],"settings":{"height":"medium","text_alignment":"center","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}}},"order":["main","image_with_text_overlay_D4wNxr","rich_text_3YdLtm","rich_text_mUnWNK","video_3cAmWm","rich_text_B8Frwy"]}
