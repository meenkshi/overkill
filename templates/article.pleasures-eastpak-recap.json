To celebrate this collaboration properly, we have organized during the Berlin Fashion Week, once again a refined party. At \"Zum starken August\", a crazy bar in Prenzlauer Berg, we found the perfect location. We already did our shooting for the Pleasures x Eastpak collection there and also our very silent models were present at the event. DJ JNS and Moneyama, who shared the turntables, provided the right music to heat the mood. Babyb3ns and Souly each had a live performance in between and ensured the small bar was shaking and the dancefloor was full. The good weather made sure that one could enjoy the drinks sponsored by us in front of the venue. The atmosphere was great and everyone had a good time, which is the most important thing at such events. We are already looking forward to the upcoming events and that you will all be there again.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}}},"block_order":["text_Nk9EaR"],"settings":{"height":"small","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}},"featured_collection_rFmKpr":{"type":"featured-collection","settings":{"title":"Eastpak x Pleasures","collection":"eastpak","show_vendor":false,"enable_carousel":true,"grid":4,"rows":1,"color_scheme":"default","show_view_all":true,"full_width":true}},"rich_text_Yn7rMH":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"image_cHNRCW":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_eastpak_x_pleasures_party_recap_4x5-28_copy.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_6aWwRF":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_eastpak_x_pleasures_party_recap_4x5-10_copy.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_4qGge8":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_eastpak_x_pleasures_party_recap_4x5-22_copy.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_JqmBD9":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_eastpak_x_pleasures_party_recap_4x5-2_copy.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_pJHcmN":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_eastpak_x_pleasures_party_recap_4x5-16_copy_2.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_RFmzTg":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_eastpak_x_pleasures_party_recap_4x5-14_copy.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_VbEmwH":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_eastpak_x_pleasures_party_recap_4x5-8_copy.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_tb8dUD":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_eastpak_x_pleasures_party_recap_4x5-23_copy_2.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_NtwVc3":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/overkill_eastpak_x_pleasures_party_recap_4x5-25_copy.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}}},"block_order":["image_cHNRCW","image_6aWwRF","image_4qGge8","image_JqmBD9","image_pJHcmN","image_RFmzTg","image_VbEmwH","image_tb8dUD","image_NtwVc3"],"settings":{"height":"medium","text_alignment":"center","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}}},"order":["main","rich_text_3YdLtm","rich_text_mUnWNK","featured_collection_rFmKpr","rich_text_Yn7rMH"]}
