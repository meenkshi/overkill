We're talking about Blokecore or Ladcore. “Bloke” or lad is a term for “guy” in English, which is interesting in this respect because Blokecore has been a unisex phenomenon since 2021. Unlike hooligans or casuals, for example, where club affiliation is rather difficult to identify visually, Blokecore puts your favorite football club in the spotlight. In the original sense, a football shirt is combined with normal clothing. However, it should be mentioned at this point that not all fans of Blokecore are automatically football fans, or at least not of the club whose shirt they are wearing. In the very special world of football shirts, there are also extremely special versions, collector's items or vintage pieces inherited from your father. Of course, the names of top-class footballers are also popular on the jerseys - Beckham, Zidane, Ibrahimovic. But not only jerseys are allowed within Blokecore. Sweatshirts, training jackets, or pants from clubs or simply brands without a club symbol are also allowed. Classic sneakers such as the adidas Samba or the City models round off the look perfectly with classic blue jeans. Blokecore will certainly be seen more often this year, as the European Football Championships are taking place.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_4FkKwJ":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/BLOKE.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}}},"block_order":["text_Nk9EaR","text_4zCfqy","image_4FkKwJ"],"settings":{"height":"small","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}},"product_list_8eFQ6C":{"type":"product-list","settings":{"title":"","product_list":["ellesse-lorenzo-bucket-hat-saaa0839-011-black","adidas-juventus-icon-jersey-hs9807-white","wasted-paris-casper-feeler-pant-166347-washed-blue-washed-blue","adidas-handball-spezial-db3021-core-black-footwear-white-gum-5","adidas-dfb-away-jersey-96-it7751-big-sur","carhartt-wip-w-orlean-skirt-i033015-1xx-06-03-orelan-stripe-black-white","kidsuper-studios-kissing-bag-aw23-bag-14-autumn","adidas-samba-og-b75806-footwear-white-core-black-clear-granite"],"show_vendor":true,"enable_carousel":false,"grid":4,"color_scheme":"default","full_width":true}},"rich_text_azk86h":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"text_n6N8bA":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p><strong>ANGELCORE<br\/><\/strong>Angelcore is a contemporary aesthetic inspired by angels. In terms of style, it resembles Rococo, a fashion from the 18th century. The idea is to imitate the supernatural beauty of angels. However, this does not mean that you have to walk through the city with angel wings. Both angelic clothing, such as white or transparent fabrics or golden details, and clothing with angel motifs are used in Angelcore. The fashion trend tends to be more popular with women, but as we all know, anything goes, so we also have outfits for men. In addition to angels, other indispensable motifs for Angelcore are butterflies, garlands, clouds, glitter, wings, and harps.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_E3mBch":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/ANGEL.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_zJdhty":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>More items from Angelcore can be found <a href=\"https:\/\/gate194.berlin\/collections\/all-cores-are-beautiful\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">here at GATE.<\/span><\/a><\/p>","enlarge_text":false}}},"block_order":["text_n6N8bA","image_E3mBch","text_zJdhty"],"settings":{"height":"small","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}},"product_list_BkAeRV":{"type":"product-list","settings":{"title":"","product_list":["arte-antwerp-stockton-heart-patch-aw23-101s-white","kidsuper-studios-hand-embroidered-suit-bottom-aw23-sub-3-black","nike-air-force-1-07-fresh-dm0211-100-white-white-white","nike-jacquemus-x-nike-wmns-nrg-dri-fit-dress-dn3243-100-white","nike-p-6000-cn0149-001-metallic-silver-metallic-silver-sail"],"show_vendor":false,"enable_carousel":true,"grid":5,"color_scheme":"default","full_width":true}},"rich_text_jR6eNY":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"text_PJxYka":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p><strong>DEVILCORE<br\/><\/strong>There is no angel without a devil!
