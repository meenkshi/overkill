Both were outdoor enthusiasts themselves and wanted to use their personal and professional experience to establish a new brand. They found the perfect third partner for their endeavor in Randy Merrell. Randy was a shoemaker who made customized and highly acclaimed hiking boots. In 1981, the three founded a company that would bear the name MERRELL. The trio had a clear vision: to develop high-quality, high-performance hiking boots that combined comfort and durability. As early as 1982, the first affordable high-performance shoe was launched on the market. The outstanding quality and comfort laid the foundation for the brand's success. In the following years, Merrell expanded its product portfolio and developed into a comprehensive outdoor brand. Innovation and a commitment to quality always remained at the center of the company's activities. Today, Merrell is known for its wide range of outdoor footwear, apparel, and equipment specifically designed to meet the demands of a variety of outdoor activities. In 1986 Randy Merrell left the company, although it kept its name. From 1987 to 1992, the company was part of the Finnish sneaker brand Karhu. They shifted production mainly to Asia to save costs and maximize profits. From 1990, the brand sold up to 300,000 pairs of shoes a year worldwide. In the 1990s, the brand expanded around the world and opened branches in Canada, the UK, and Scandinavia. In 1997, Karhu sold the Merrel brand to Wolverine World Wide, a company that produced its own shoes, and Merrel remains part of the WWW Foundation to this day. The most successful model in the company's history is the Merrell Jungle Moc, of which over 10,000,000 pairs have been sold to date. From 1995, Merrell trainers were equipped with the hard-wearing Vibram sole, which gives the range even more durability and flexibility.<\/p><p>As many brands have proven before, performance sneakers are finding their way into the lifestyle segment. Merrel shoes are not only useful for longer hiking tours, but they also offer advantages in the urban jungle.
