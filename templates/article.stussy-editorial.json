For more than 40 years, the iconic brand from sunny California has been around. The founder Shawn Stussy was a local surfer and began to write his unique name on self-made surfboards. Even though Shawn ceded the brand to his partner Frank Sinatra Jr. back in the '90s, his inspiration and graphics remain a staple of Stussy to this day. With influences from the surf, skater, punk, and hip-hop scenes, the brand created a style all its own and laid the foundation to be one of the most recognized streetwear brands in the world to this day.<br\/><br\/>Iconic graphics, such as the graffiti-inspired Stussy tag on T-shirts or long sleeves, the legendary 8-ball graphic or apparel decorated with positive reggae vibes, have made Stussy a true legend among streetwear brands. To a wider awareness around the world, have also contributed the collaborations with exciting partners. There is probably no major brand that Stussy hasn't collaborated with, so it's no wonder that the brand is called the king of collaborations. Stussy and Nike have been closely linked for decades and besides sneakers, they have also implemented a lot of apparel together. Stussy and Bape was a collaboration that was very well received not only in Japan. Stussy and Vans is a no-brainer, as both brands are deeply rooted in the surf and skateboard scene. Stussy and Supreme have united two absolute giants of streetwear. This list could be continued endlessly and each of these Stussy collaborations has helped manifest the brand's high profile. Some of them were expected, or at least that's what you hoped for. Some of them, however, have been a revelation in a positive sense even for die-hard fans.<br\/><br\/>Despite the length of time Stussy has been in the streetwear game, the brand has managed to keep reinventing itself without forgetting its roots. Ever-new motifs and designs, all embodying the Stussy ethos, are used alongside old-school styles for new collections. The good mood attitude of the brand is contagious and passes on to both the wearer of the clothes and observers. May Stussy continue to put a smile on everyone's face for a very long time.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_tnzxEz":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_StussyEditorial_Hamza_0012.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_jBnAq6":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_StussyEditorial_Hamza_0001.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_r7TEEF":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_StussyEditorial_Hamza_0006.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_Hykf4Q":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_StussyEditorial_Hamza_0005.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_wzjP4R":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_StussyEditorial_Hamza_0007.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_BeNb6e":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_StussyEditorial_Hamza_0002.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_YHPR7D":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_StussyEditorial_Hamza_0009.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_VWx94P":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_StussyEditorial_Hamza_0003.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_pBGjx9":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_StussyEditorial_Hamza_0010.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_GzjRHa":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Overkill_StussyEditorial_Hamza_0004.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}}},"block_order":["text_Nk9EaR","image_tnzxEz","image_jBnAq6","image_r7TEEF","image_Hykf4Q","image_wzjP4R","image_BeNb6e","image_YHPR7D","image_VWx94P","image_pBGjx9","image_GzjRHa"],"settings":{"height":"small","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}}},"order":["main","image_with_text_overlay_D4wNxr","rich_text_3YdLtm","rich_text_mUnWNK"]}
