Normcore is a unisex style characterized by inconspicuous, average clothing. The term combines the words “normal” and “hardcore”, so it is primarily about not standing out. Normcore didn't want to try hard to be cool, it was cool to be normal. Sounds kind of crazy, as everyone tries to express themselves with their outfits. Normcore, however, limits itself to the essentials and proves that you can also shine fashionably with normal clothes, without a lot of color or patterns. Normcore includes everyday items of clothing such as T-shirts, short-sleeved shirts, hoodies, chinos, or jeans. <\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_9D6Bwg":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/GIF_NORM.gif","image_width":700,"url":""}}},"block_order":["text_9FVBDf","text_yyCBpn","image_9D6Bwg"],"settings":{"height":"medium","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}},"product_list_CKTnbH":{"type":"product-list","settings":{"title":"","product_list":["polo-ralph-lauren-corduroy-wb-lined-shirt-jacket-710914227002-dispatch-tan","carhartt-wip-chase-sweat-i033660-00c-xx-03-dark-grey-heather-gold","carhartt-wip-simple-pant-i022947-01-06-32-blue-stone-washed","veja-w-urca-cwl-white-camel-uc0703151a","carhartt-wip-hooded-taos-sweat-i032923-654-gd-03-flint","the-north-face-w-tnf-jacket-2000-nf0a7urfi0g-misty-sage","carhartt-wip-w-pierce-pant-i025268-01-47-00-blue-light","reebok-club-c-revenge-100072385-footwear-white-green-gold"],"show_vendor":true,"enable_carousel":false,"grid":4,"color_scheme":"default","full_width":true}},"rich_text_3UDFWa":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"text_X7f6tt":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p><strong>GOTHCORE<br\/><\/strong>It's not far from Devilcore (coming soon) to Gothcore - there are some similarities.
