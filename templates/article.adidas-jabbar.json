Originally introduced in 1978, it was the first basketball shoe designed for an athlete - none other than basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The six-time NBA champion shaped an entire era with his iconic skyhook shot, and the sneaker reflected his dominance on the court. Today, almost 50 years later, the shoe is experiencing a renaissance and appeals to a younger generation that appreciates retro fashion and basketball aesthetics.<br\/><br\/>The Adidas Jabbar is characterized by its minimalist yet sporty design. The latest new edition remains true to its roots, but features modern accents that make it a stylish statement. The Off White\/Collegiate Royal version will be released first. The low-top and high-top versions play with a nostalgic colour scheme - an elegant creamy white leather with bold blue stripes and heels. <\/p>","enlarge_text":false}}},"block_order":["text_8EApxy"],"settings":{"height":"medium","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}},"rich_text_GnFUAi":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"image_TLUHan":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-3_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_6NzGeN":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-15_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_946XpQ":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-18_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_LEVJ6n":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-6_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_Nm3kQq":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-5_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"text_bUP87t":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>What makes the adidas Jabbar special, however, is the close connection to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar himself. This sneaker tells the story of one of the most successful basketball players of all time. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar still holds the record for the most points in the NBA and has been honoured as the most valuable player several times. His career, which spanned over 20 years, and his successes on and off the court make him a living legend. The sneaker is more than just a fashion item - it is a symbol of success, hard work and inimitable style. While the adidas Jabbar was originally developed as a performance basketball shoe, today it has found a new role. In line with the current trend of integrating classic trainers into streetwear culture, the Jabbar is now being reinterpreted as a versatile lifestyle shoe. It can be worn both on the<br\/>basketball court and in everyday life and perfectly captures the spirit of the times. The clean, simple silhouette of the Jabbar sneaker is reminiscent of the timeless style of the 70s, but modern updates and limited editions have made it more relevant than ever. The Jabbar combines retro aesthetics with the demands of today's fashion, appealing to sneakerheads and basketball fans alike.<\/p>","enlarge_text":false}},"image_F9zaMC":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-17_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_eWbfLi":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-14_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_bD3DMR":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-10_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_BUc3pR":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-2_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_3YTgUq":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-7_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_ndRQya":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Leonie__Busse_x_Overkill_feed-9_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}},"image_7jVt8j":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Bildschirmfoto_2024-10-10_um_16.17.48_Kopie.webp","image_width":700,"url":""}}},"block_order":["image_TLUHan","image_6NzGeN","image_946XpQ","image_LEVJ6n","image_Nm3kQq","text_bUP87t","image_F9zaMC","image_eWbfLi","image_bD3DMR","image_BUc3pR","image_3YTgUq","image_ndRQya","image_7jVt8j"],"settings":{"height":"medium","text_alignment":"left","full_width":false,"color_scheme":"default"}}},"order":["main","rich_text_3YdLtm","rich_text_mUnWNK","featured_product_yyNN4J","featured_product_8MUXFz","rich_text_PU68Gy","rich_text_GnFUAi"]}
